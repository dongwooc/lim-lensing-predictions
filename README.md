# lim-lensing-predictions

This repository serves as a companion to [a 2022 paper in MNRAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12581) and should host the following files:
* code.ipynb containing all code and calculations required to reproduce the results of the paper (with code-refresponse.ipynb containing some additional work generated while the paper was in review),
* transmission.dat containing atmospheric transmission from the ATM model via [https://www.apex-telescope.org/ns/weather/],
* unimachsfr.py containing the implementation of the UniverseMachine SFR model parameterisation [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07893],
* emceerun.h5 containing data from the MCMC parameter constraint forecast,
* and all plots generated by code*.ipynb for the preprint, saved as both pdf and 288dpi png files.
